IOT is the protocol token of the [Helium IoT Network](/lorawan-on-helium). IOT was introduced to the
Helium Network with the community proposal
[HIP-52](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0052-iot-dao.md) and is further defined in
subsequent HIPs[^1] [^2] [^3] [^4].

The IOT token is mined by LoRaWAN Hotspots through both data transfer as well as Proof of Coverage.

[^1]:
    [HIP-70: Scaling the Helium Network](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0070-scaling-helium.md)

[^2]:
    [HIP-76: Linear Lockup Curve](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0076-linear-lockup-curve.md)

[^3]: [HIP-77: Solana Parameters](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0077-solana-parameters.md)
[^4]:
    [HIP-80: Simplifying DAO Utility Score](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0080-simplifying-dao-utility-score.md)

The first IOT tokens were minted following the Solana migration on April 18, 2023.  
The mint address for IOT is
[`iotEVVZLEywoTn1QdwNPddxPWszn3zFhEot3MfL9fns`](https://explorer.solana.com/address/iotEVVZLEywoTn1QdwNPddxPWszn3zFhEot3MfL9fns)

## Treasury

The Treasury is funded by activity within epochs. It is your right as a Token Holder to redeem IOT
for HNT. This redemption will be determined by a redemption ratio that is set algorithmically by the
Treasury swap contacts. This function is built into the structure of the subDAOs but other Market
Makers may also support this function.

## Token Allocation

IOT follows a similar minting schedule to HNT, however at a max supply of 200,000,000,000 (200B).

The issuance is scheduled to have halvings every 2 years, aligning with HNT issuance halvings.

The emission schedule is as follows:

| Year | IOT at the start of the year | IOT minted | % to Proof of Coverage (+ any extra from Data Transfer) | % to Data Transfer (excess to Proof of Coverage) | % to Oracles | Operations Fund | veHNT Stakers |
